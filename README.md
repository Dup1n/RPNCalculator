# RPN Calculator

It's a simple calculator with Reverse Polish Notation, which we implemented operations like:
+ **Enter** = push an number in the stack (add)
+ **Addition** = addition with a value and the last element in the stack (sum)
+ **Subtraction** = substraction with a value minus the last element in the stack (sub)
+ **Multiply** = multiplication between two values (mul)
+ **Division** = division between two values (div)
+ **Sqrt** = square root of a value (sqrt)
+ **Power** = value power according the last element in the stack (power)
+ **Inverse** = 1 / value
+ **Swap** = swaping between a value and the last element in the stack (swap)
+ **AC** = remove all elements in the stack

We did Unit Testing with some operations.

The project is made in:
+ _Java 8_
+ _JUnit_
